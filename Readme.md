## Example to use webdriverajax in your project

This repo exemplifies the usage of [webdriverajax](https://github.com/chmanie/webdriverajax) in your `webdriverio` project. Additionally it uses

- `wdio-mocha-framework`
- `wdio-selenium-standalone-service`
- `wdio-spec-reporter`

Also `budo` is used to provide an example page (this will likely be the page you'd like to test so you don't need to set this up).

### Configuration

See the `wdio.conf.js` on how to integrate webdriverajax properly.

### To run the tests:

```
npm test
```

### Licence
